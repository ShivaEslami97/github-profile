# github profile search
Inspired by [dribbble design](<https://dribbble.com/shots/10670840-User-Profile-UI-Component>) \
\
A simple app for searching github profiles.\
The app is simple, there's an input to put the github username, and if the user exists, is shown the user Github profile information, else, is shown an error.\

The API I used was the [free Github Api](<https://api.github.com/users/>).
